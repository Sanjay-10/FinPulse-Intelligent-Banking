# Backend Microservices

All backend microservices are now moved to independent GitHub repositories for a true polyrepo architecture.

Below are the links to each service:

- **Auth Service** → https://github.com/Sanjay-10/FinPulse/auth-service
- **Account Service** → https://github.com/Sanjay-10/FinPulse/account-service
- **Transaction Service** → https://github.com/Sanjay-10/FinPulse/transaction-service
- **Audit Service** → https://github.com/Sanjay-10/FinPulse/audit-service
- **Notification Service** → https://github.com/Sanjay-10/FinPulse/notification-service
- **Insight Service** → https://github.com/Sanjay-10/FinPulse/insight-service
- **Config Server** → https://github.com/Sanjay-10/FinPulse/config-server
- **Discovery Server** → https://github.com/Sanjay-10/FinPulse/discovery-server
- **API Gateway** → https://github.com/Sanjay-10/FinPulse/gateway-service

All services run independently but integrate through Eureka, Config Server, API Gateway, and Kafka.
